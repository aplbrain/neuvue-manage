# Generic State Task

A no-frills task that creates tasks based on a pre-existing neuroglancer state of the Minnie65 dataset. Useful for testing and for simple tasks where all you need is to enqueue a set of pre-generated neuroglancer states. Best use with a simple "Submit Button" submission method.

| Task Namespace          | `micronsTest` |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Submission Method       | Submit Button |
| CAVE Required?          | No            |
| External Data Required? | No            |


## Creating Tasks

Run the `minnie_generic_tasks` notebook from start to finish to create the tasks in the queue. Make sure to edit the notebook variables, such as namespace and assignee, to the specific task type and people you want to add the task for.
